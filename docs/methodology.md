# Research Methodology

## Overview

This database employs rigorous academic research methods to collect, verify, and present taxation data from imperial China and comparative civilizations. All data sources meet strict scholarly standards to ensure reliability and reproducibility.

## Source Selection Criteria

### Academic Standards
- **Peer-reviewed publications only**: Journal articles, academic monographs, and dissertations from recognized institutions
- **Primary source preference**: Contemporary historical documents, archaeological evidence, and administrative records
- **Multi-language research**: Sources consulted in Chinese, English, Japanese, German, French, and other relevant languages
- **Cross-verification**: Multiple independent sources required for each data point

### Excluded Sources
- Wikipedia and other crowd-sourced platforms
- Popular media and journalism
- Non-peer-reviewed websites and blogs
- Unsubstantiated claims without academic citation

## Data Collection Process

### 1. Literature Review
- Systematic search of academic databases (JSTOR, Project MUSE, China Academic Journals)
- Consultation of specialized historical economics and sinology journals
- Review of recent dissertations and conference proceedings
- Analysis of both quantitative and qualitative historical evidence

### 2. Source Evaluation
Each source is evaluated for:
- **Authority**: Scholar credentials and institutional affiliation
- **Accuracy**: Consistency with other reliable sources
- **Currency**: Recent scholarship incorporating latest archaeological findings
- **Objectivity**: Methodological transparency and acknowledgment of limitations

### 3. Data Verification
- **Primary source checking**: Verification against original historical texts when possible
- **Expert consultation**: Review by specialists in Chinese history and economic history
- **Statistical validation**: Cross-checking of quantitative claims and calculations
- **Regional variation analysis**: Recognition of geographical and temporal differences

## Comparative Methodology

### Standardization Challenges
Converting historical taxation data into comparable formats requires addressing:
- **Currency differences**: Various monetary systems and units
- **Economic base variations**: Different economic structures (agricultural vs. commercial)
- **Collection method differences**: In-kind vs. cash payments
- **Administrative capacity variations**: Centralized vs. decentralized collection

### Comparative Metrics
Standard measures used for comparison:
- **GDP percentage estimates**: Total tax burden as share of estimated economic output
- **Agricultural output shares**: Taxes as percentage of harvest yield
- **Per capita burden**: Tax load relative to estimated individual income
- **Gini coefficient estimates**: Distribution of tax burden across social classes

## Data Quality Assessment

### Reliability Ratings
Each data point receives a reliability rating:
- **High**: Multiple corroborating academic sources with primary evidence
- **Medium**: Single authoritative source or conflicting evidence from multiple sources  
- **Low**: Limited sources or significant uncertainty in historical record
- **Speculative**: Scholarly estimates based on incomplete evidence

### Confidence Intervals
Where possible, data includes:
- Range estimates rather than point estimates
- Acknowledgment of seasonal and cyclical variations
- Recognition of differences between nominal and effective rates
- Documentation of regional and temporal exceptions

## Limitations and Caveats

### Historical Record Limitations
- **Survival bias**: Better documentation for certain periods and regions
- **Elite perspective**: Most historical sources reflect ruling class viewpoint
- **Administrative capacity**: Variations in record-keeping across dynasties
- **Political motivations**: Potential bias in official historical accounts

### Methodological Constraints
- **Economic estimation**: Ancient GDP and population figures are approximate
- **Currency conversion**: Historical exchange rates often unknown or unstable
- **Regional variation**: Difficulty capturing local differences in large empires
- **Temporal changes**: Evolution of tax systems within single dynasties

### Comparative Analysis Issues
- **Different economic systems**: Subsistence vs. market-oriented economies
- **Administrative differences**: Bureaucratic vs. feudal collection systems
- **Geographic factors**: Climate, terrain, and resource availability effects
- **Cultural context**: Different concepts of taxation and state obligations

## Future Research Directions

### Data Expansion
- Incorporation of newly discovered archaeological evidence
- Translation and analysis of additional primary sources
- Regional case studies for more granular analysis
- Extension to additional dynasties and comparative civilizations

### Methodological Improvements
- Development of more sophisticated economic estimation techniques
- Integration of archaeological and textual evidence
- Application of computational methods for pattern recognition
- Collaboration with economic historians and quantitative specialists

## Quality Control

### Peer Review Process
- All major data additions reviewed by subject matter experts
- Regular auditing of sources and calculations  
- Community feedback through GitHub issue system
- Annual comprehensive review and updates

### Documentation Standards
- Complete citation information for all sources
- Transparent methodology for all calculations and estimates
- Version control for tracking changes and corrections
- Regular backup and archival of data and documentation
